â˜Ž Phoney 
=============================
Phoney extracts US phone numbers from HTML and arbitrary text.

What it's not for
-------
Unsolicited phone calls. Don't call people who you shouldn't call. Don't be that guy.

What it's for
-------
You can use it for anything *not* evil.

I created it to find if the business's in my database had an official website so we could link to it.

By exluding a list of known directory sites and checking to make sure a website included the phone number (and not a large list of them) along with the business name and postal address I was able to find a business's website with a high level of accuracy.

If you need to parse unstructured data to highlight phone numbers, make them links, prevent the sharing of personal information, etc, this code is efficient enough to run client or server-side and may fit your needs.
